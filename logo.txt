Building reusable steps is one of the rare ideological goals that actually works very well in practice. Lets split up Cucumber’s architecture into three parts. You have the code under test, the cucumber scenario, and your cucumber steps. When you have a failure it can crop up at either the scenario level or the step level. Debugging steps can be a pain in the ass because a scenario can use a hodge-podge of steps that are littered across multiple files AND require context of the steps executed prior.
